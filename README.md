  <li> Videos table. Create one table to keep track of the videos. This table should include a unique ID,
the title of the video, the length in minutes, and the URL. Populate the table with at least three
related videos from YouTube or other publicly available resources
</li>

<li>Create and populate Reviewers table. Create a second table that provides at least two user
reviews for each of at least two of the videos. These should be imaginary reviews that include
columns for the user’s name (“Asher”, “John”, etc.), the rating (which could be NULL, or a
number between 0 and 5), and a short text review (“Loved it!”). There should be a column that
links back to the ID column in the table of videos.
